An open source generative art project using a "liquify" effect that pushes and swirls colours on a canvas. The effect is created directly in the browser, using an HTML5 canvas element.

Live website: https://collidingscopes.github.io/liquify

You can liquify the canvas manually by dragging/clicking, or instead you can run a generative animation that will draw random paths across the canvas.

There are options to export the canvas as an image or video.

Built using javascript, HTML, CSS.

Enormous thanks and credits to <a href="https://github.com/cbosco/canvas-liquify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Bosco</a>, who provided the initial code to create this effect.
